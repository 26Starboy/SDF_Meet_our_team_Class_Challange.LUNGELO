# Instructions

Build a responsive web page that displays a grid of profile cards using Flexbox, with a mobile-friendly design. Each card should have a picture, name, role, and a short bio.

Requirements:
- HTML Structure
- Use <!DOCTYPE html>, and appropriate semantic tags.
- Include a header with the page title (e.g., “Meet Our Team”).
- Use a main section to hold all profile cards.
- Each profile card should be in a div or article tag.

Profile Card Content (use placeholder content)
- A circular photo https://images.pexels.com/photos/771742/pexels-photo-771742.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=600
- A name (e.g., “Jane Doe”)
- A role (e.g., “Frontend Developer”)
- A short bio (1–2 sentences)

CSS Styling
- Center the page content.
- Use Flexbox to create a row layout for the cards.
- Make the cards visually appealing: padding, border-radius, box-shadow.
- Use a consistent font and spacing.

Responsive Design
- On screens wider than 768px: display the cards in a row (3 per row) using Flexbox.
- On screens smaller than 768px: display the cards in a column (stacked).
- Ensure the layout and text remain readable at all screen sizes.
